# Crisis Mapping Prototype (Experimental)

This folder contains an experimental proof-of-concept exploring
how crisis-related text data can be enriched with:

- urgency scoring
- simple geolocation heuristics
- map-based visualization

Disclaimer:
- This work is exploratory and not production-ready
- A pre-trained sentiment model is used as a proxy for urgency
- Heuristic rules are applied for demonstration purposes
- This prototype is not part of the main CrisisLens model evaluation (V1/V2)
