CrisisLens – Model Evaluation Results

Model: TF-IDF + Logistic Regression
Dataset: Disaster Tweets (Kaggle)

Train / Validation Split:
- 80% train
- 20% validation
- Stratified on target label

Validation Metrics:
- Accuracy: ~0.80
- Precision (weighted): ~0.80
- Recall (weighted): ~0.80
- F1-score (weighted): ~0.80

Notes:
- Bigram TF-IDF (1,2) with max_features=10,000
- Logistic Regression with max_iter=1000
- Baseline classical ML model (CrisisLens V1)

Next Steps:
- Upgrade to transformer-based classifier (DistilBERT)
- Improve recall for high-urgency disaster tweets
