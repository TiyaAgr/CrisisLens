CrisisLens — Model Evaluation Metrics
====================================

Dataset:
- Binary classification (Crisis vs Non-Crisis)
- Test samples: 1523

------------------------------------

Model V1: TF-IDF + Logistic Regression

Accuracy: 81.55%

Class-wise Performance:
- Class 0 (Non-Crisis):
  Precision: 0.80
  Recall:    0.90
  F1-score:  0.85
- Class 1 (Crisis):
  Precision: 0.84
  Recall:    0.70
  F1-score:  0.77

Macro Avg F1:    0.81
Weighted Avg F1: 0.81

Observations:
- Strong baseline with high recall for non-crisis content
- Struggles with contextual ambiguity in crisis detection

------------------------------------

Model V2: DistilBERT (Fine-tuned)

Best Epoch: 2

Accuracy: 84.31%
F1-score: 0.81

Training Loss:    0.1847
Validation Loss:  0.4253

Observations:
- Improves overall accuracy over TF-IDF baseline
- Better semantic and contextual understanding
- Early signs of overfitting after epoch 2, indicating optimal early stopping

------------------------------------

Conclusion:
- Transformer-based model outperforms traditional ML baseline
- DistilBERT offers a favorable trade-off between performance and efficiency
